## ⚡ Technology Stack

Our platform is built on a high-concurrency, low-latency stack designed for real-time telemetry and 3D visualization.

- **Frontend**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) for high-performance rendering.
- **Design System**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with custom Glassmorphism components.
- **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) & [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/).
- **3D Visualization**: [Spline](https://spline.design/) for interactive mission control dashboards.
- **Visual Effects**: Custom shaders for radar sweeps and holographic HUDs.
